# APIs

An API is an interface. It's something that has been created to help two different systems interact with one another.

#### Benefits

1. It doesn't expose the implementation to those who shouldn't have access to it
2. The API provides a standard way of accessing the application
3. It makes it much easier to understand how to access the application's data

Frequently used APIs are
