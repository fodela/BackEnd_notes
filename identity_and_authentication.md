### Brief Intro to Problems with Passwords

Some issues with passwords are outside of our control as developers. Many issues come from user behavior that we cannot directly influence, such as:

- Users forget their passwords
- Users use simple passwords
- Users use common passwords
- Users repeat passwords
- Users share passwords

In contrast, some issues are within our control as developers:

- Passwords can be compromised
- Developers can incorrectly check
- Developers can cut corners
