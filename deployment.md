# Deployment

## Container and Deployment Overview

A **container** is a running piece of software that bundles code along with all of its dependencies, including system tools, libraries, or configuration files. Building your application in a container allows the application to run consistently in any environment, whether that environment is another computer's operating system or cloud deployment.

**Deployment** is the process of making an application run in the production environment. Deployment can be done manually or can be automated. Kubernetes is a container orchestration system that automates container deployment, scaling, and management and will be used in this course.
